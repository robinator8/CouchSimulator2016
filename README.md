I made this game when I was 15 at a two week summer camp at Vassar College called 'Game Programming with Unity and C#".

FAQ
Where is the source code?

I built this game using a school issued laptop that I no longer have access to. Unfortunately I did not transfer the source code so it's gone forever.

What the features of the game?

You control a couch. There is a city. There are automatically generating waffels that grow then shrink so you must keep moving forward.

Why are you using a google drive download link?

Some files exceed the 100 mb file limit set by GitHub
